# IsItRainingInManchester - https://ruthenewman.github.io/IsItRainingInManchester/

Day 4 of challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects over 30 days (weather app for Manchester), that proves that it isn't always
raining in Manchester!

A vanilla JS project with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css), as well as using a skycons.js file for 
the weather icons.

The temperature and weather summaries are taken from the Dark Sky API using the public API key and the longitude and latitude
for Manchester.
